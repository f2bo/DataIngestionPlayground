# Ancient Egypt

Ancient Egypt was a civilization along the Nile River that lasted for more than 3,000 years. It is known for monumental architecture such as pyramids, temples, and statues, as well as its complex religious beliefs and writing system, hieroglyphics.

The Nile's predictable flooding enabled stable agriculture, supporting a highly organized society ruled by pharaohs, who were considered divine. Egyptian advances in mathematics, medicine, and engineering influenced later cultures.

Many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture — including mummification and monumental tombs — were tied to beliefs about the afterlife and the preservation of the soul.
