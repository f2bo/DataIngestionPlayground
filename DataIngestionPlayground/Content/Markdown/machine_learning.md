# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence focused on building systems that learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed. Algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, or classify information based on training examples.

There are several major approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Each method is suited to different types of problems, such as image recognition, anomaly detection, or game-playing agents.

Machine learning has become widespread in modern technology, powering recommendation systems, fraud detection, speech recognition, and self-driving vehicles.
