# The Solar System

The solar system consists of the Sun and everything bound to it by gravity, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets. It formed roughly 4.6 billion years ago from a rotating cloud of gas and dust.

There are eight major planets, divided into rocky terrestrial planets and gas or ice giants. Earth is the only planet known to support life. The outer regions contain the Kuiper Belt and the distant Oort Cloud, home to many icy bodies.

The Sun, a medium-sized star, provides the energy that drives climate, weather, and life on Earth.
