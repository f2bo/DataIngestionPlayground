# Renewable Energy

Renewable energy comes from sources that replenish naturally, such as sunlight, wind, water, and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, renewables generate power without releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases.

Common technologies include solar panels, wind turbines, hydropower dams, and geothermal plants. Advances in energy storage and grid management have made renewables increasingly competitive with traditional energy sources.

Transitioning to renewable energy is a key strategy for reducing carbon emissions and combating climate change.
