# Plate Tectonics

Plate tectonics is the scientific theory that Earth's outer shell is divided into large plates that move slowly over the planet’s mantle. Their movement shapes the surface of the Earth.

Interactions between plates create geological features such as mountains, earthquakes, volcanoes, and ocean trenches. For example, the Himalayas formed from the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates.

Plate tectonics also influences climate and the distribution of continents and oceans over millions of years.
