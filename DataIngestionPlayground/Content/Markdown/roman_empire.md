# The Roman Empire

The Roman Empire was one of the most influential civilizations in history, lasting from 27 BCE to 476 CE in the West, with its eastern half—known as the Byzantine Empire—surviving for another thousand years. It was known for its extensive road networks, advanced engineering, and highly structured political and military systems.

Roman culture spread throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, leaving a lasting legacy on language, law, architecture, and government. Latin, the language of Rome, became the foundation of the Romance languages.

At its height, the empire controlled territory surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, earning it the nickname *Mare Nostrum*, or “Our Sea.”
