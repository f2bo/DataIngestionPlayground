# Coral Reefs

Coral reefs are marine ecosystems built by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps. These ecosystems are among the most diverse on Earth, supporting thousands of species of fish, invertebrates, and plants.

Coral reefs thrive in warm, shallow waters where sunlight supports the symbiotic algae that help corals grow. They provide food, coastline protection, and economic benefits through tourism and fisheries.

However, reefs are threatened by pollution, overfishing, and climate-driven bleaching events, making conservation efforts increasingly urgent.
