# The Human Brain

The human brain is the central organ of the nervous system, responsible for thought, memory, emotion, and coordination. It contains approximately 86 billion neurons, which communicate through electrical and chemical signals.

Major regions include the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem, each performing specialized functions. The cerebral cortex is associated with complex processes such as language, planning, and conscious awareness.

Despite significant scientific progress, many aspects of how the brain produces consciousness and thought remain open questions.
