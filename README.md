# Vector Store Data Ingestion Playground

A project to experiment with vector stores and data ingestion pipelines. Currently requires building [Microsoft.Extensions.DataIngestion](https://github.com/dotnet/extensions/tree/main/src/Libraries/Microsoft.Extensions.DataIngestion) from source to use the latest changes. 

Sample content to test data ingestion for various document types can be found in the `Content` directory.
